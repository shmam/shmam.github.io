      <description>Hi! My name is Sam and I am a software engineer at WillowTree. I recently graduated from NC State University where I studied Computer Science. While there, I met a ton of great people and learned a lot about gratitude. I also was able to do research and assist in the potential for DNA based information storage.
I&amp;rsquo;m an ambitious and optimistic team player who loves to work on teams with other driven engineers to build high-performance, inclusive, and socially impactful software.</description>
